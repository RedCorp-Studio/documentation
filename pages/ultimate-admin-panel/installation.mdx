# Installation

Before installing the script, please ensure that you have installed the following dependencies:
- `es_extended` (version 1.4.0 or above) or `qb-core` (version 1.1.0 or above)
- `oxmysql`

## Add ACEs
To ensure that Ultimate Admin Panel's permissions work correctly you will need to add some ACEs in your `server.cfg` file **before starting red_admin**:
```
add_ace resource.red_admin command allow
```

## Start the script
Then add `ensure red_admin` in your `server.cfg` file. Please make sure you place it after the following ressources:
- `es_extended` or `qb-core`
- `esx_multicharacter` or `qb-multicharacter` (if you use multi character)
- `ox_inventory` (if you are using it)

Finally run the ressource by typing the following commands in your server console:
```
cfx> refresh
cfx> ensure red_admin
```
