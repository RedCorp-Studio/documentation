# Common issues

## Old Permissions Syntax
Starting from version 1.3.0, you will need to migrate your permissions to a new format. To do this, please run the following command:
```plain copy
uap migrate permissions
```

## Illegal mix of collations

If you encounter the following error in Ultimate Admin Panel:

```plain filename="SQL error"
SCRIPT ERROR in promise (unhandled rejection): Error: red admin was unable to execute a query! 
Illegal mix of collations (utf8mb4_unicode_ci, IMPLICIT) and (utf8mb4_general_ci, IMPLICIT) for operation '='
```

This is caused by a mismatch of collations in the database tables. Fortunately, there is a straightforward fix for this issue. Follow the steps below to resolve the problem:

### Fixing the "Illegal mix of collations" error

1. Before making any changes to your database, it's crucial to create a backup to prevent data loss in case anything goes wrong during the process.

2. Login to your database management system with the necessary credentials. This could be through phpMyAdmin, MySQL command-line, or any other database tool you are using. Once you have access to your database, execute the following SQL queries to update the collation of the affected tables:

```sql filename="SQL queries fixing collations" copy
ALTER TABLE `red_reports`
CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

ALTER TABLE `red_reports_messages`
CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

ALTER TABLE `red_notes`
CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

ALTER TABLE `red_bans`
CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

ALTER TABLE `red_settings`
CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

ALTER TABLE `red_logins`
CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

These queries will change the collation of the specified tables (`red_reports`, `red_reports_messages`, `red_notes`, `red_bans`, `red_settings`, and `red_logins`) to `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`, which is compatible with a wide range of characters and should resolve the collation mismatch error.
