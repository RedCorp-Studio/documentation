## Find icons

To search for icons, simply visit the icons page on [Fontawesome's website](https://fontawesome.com/icons). Look for the desired icon, and then copy its icon code.

import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

## Example

Suppose you want to use the envelope icon. First, navigate to the [Fontawesome website](https://fontawesome.com/icons) and search for the icon (e.g., envelope). Once you find the icon, click on it to reveal its code, which should look like this:

![Preview](/img/notifications/envelope.png)

Then, extract the icon code from this HTML snippet and use it as an argument for the event.

HTML code:

```html filename="HTML code"
<i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i>
```

Extracted code:

```plain filename="Icon code"
fa-solid fa-envelope
```

Then, use the following code to trigger a notification:

```lua filename="Example snippet" copy
TriggerEvent(
    "red_notifications:notify",
    "New Message",
    "You have received a new message from a player.",
    "info",
    "top-right",
    "fa-solid fa-envelope",
    10000,
    "light"
)
```

This will display a notification with the title "New Message", the content "You have received a new message from a player," with an "info" color and an envelope icon, positioned at the top-right corner of the screen, and the notification will last for 10 seconds (10000 milliseconds) using the "light" theme.
